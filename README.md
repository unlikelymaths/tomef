# EvaluationThis is an evaluation framework for (mostly nonprobabilistic) topic models.It is written in Python and uses a Jupyter Lab Interface.Using the latter is recommended, but not neccessary if you only want to run the basic scripts.If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Lab, see https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ for an introduction.## Installation1. Clone repository2. Requirements  This software requires Python 3 ( https://www.python.org/ ). It was tested with version 3.6, but other versions might also work. Additionally you will need Node.js ( https://nodejs.org/ )  - Instructions with pip and virtualenv      Within the root folder of this framework execute the following commands:    - setup a virtual environment with `virtualenv env`    - activate the environment with        Windows: `.\env\Scripts\activate`        Linux: `source env/bin/activate`      - install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`    - make shure you execute all following commands in the virtual environment3. Jupyter Widgets  To enable Jupyer Widgets run  `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager`4. Converting notebooks to python (optional)  Notebooks can be automatically converted to py files for using their definitions in  other modules. To enable this add the following code<sup>1</sup> to your `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`. If it doesn't exist run `jupyter notebook --generate-config`.Note that this will affect all notebooks you run, but will only convert files ending with `.py.ipynb`.```pythonimport osfrom subprocess import check_calldef post_save(model, os_path, contents_manager):    """post-save hook for converting notebooks to .py scripts"""    d, fname = os.path.split(os_path)    if model['type'] != 'notebook' or not fname.endswith('.py.ipynb'):        return # only do this for notebooks ending with .py.ipynb    name_out = fname[:-9] #remove '.py.ipynb'    check_call(['jupyter', 'nbconvert', '--to', 'script', '--output', name_out, fname], cwd=d)c.FileContentsManager.post_save_hook = post_save```## Running1. Start jupyter lab with `jupyter lab`. Your browser should open the jupyter lab page. Otherwise copy the link given in the command line.2. The `evaluation.py.ipynb` notebook is the recommended place to start.3. Check `importer/datasets.ipynb` for instructions to install datasets.4. Check `embedding/embedding.ipynb` for instructions to install embedding models.## Footnotes1.
